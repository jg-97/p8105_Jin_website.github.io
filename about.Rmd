## Here is an introduction 

I’m Jin Ge. You can call me Jin. I’m pursuing a Master of Science in Biostatistics expecting to graduate in May 2021. I have reviewed what you have posted online and found that you are offering an internship in summer 2020, the next summer. I have review your information online and found that my experience of interning in CDC and leading or completing research by myself is quite fit your demands. My experience gave me the ability to get along well with others and self-learn applied software. Hope to meet with you.
